## Why These Three?

**Quest Editing** fixes a critical usability gap that will frustrate users immediately.

**Loading States** makes the app feel professional and responsive, addressing the most common UX complaint in AI-powered apps.

**Statistics Dashboard** adds the addictive gamification element that makes todo apps sticky, increasing long-term engagement.

These three form a complete "polish package":
1. Fix critical gap (editing)
2. Improve perceived quality (loading/errors)
3. Add engagement hook (stats/gamification)

**Combined Implementation Time:** 9-13 hours
**Combined User Impact:** Very High
**Risk Level:** Low (no major architecture changes)
**Dependencies:** None (can be built independently)
